### MySQL Playground

This is a super basic app for querying a database. I wrote it this morning in a couple of hours as a proof of concept so don't expect a rich feature set. Set up with `bower install && npm install` then run `npm start`. You'll have to edit the database you are setting up in the `mysql-test` element for the moment, but when I get around to it I'll add a UI modal for logging into the database.
